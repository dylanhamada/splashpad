# splashpad

A superficial copy of unsplash.com to practice HTML and CSS.

A live version of Splashpad can be viewed [here](https://dylanhamada.github.io/splashpad).

Unsplash is one of my favourite websites. It's a great source of open source photos for use in personal projects.

It also uses a nice minimalist design that is relatively straightforward to copy using basic CSS techniques.

On Splashpad, I'm focusing only on recreating the basic look of Unsplash, and its basic responsiveness across different screen sizes.
