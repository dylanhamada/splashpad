# Splashpad

A superficial copy of [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com) to practice HTML and CSS.

A live version of Splashpad can be viewed [here](https://dylanhamada.github.io/splashpad).

Unsplash is one of my favourite websites. It's a great source of open source photos for use in personal projects.

It also uses a nice minimalist design that is relatively straightforward to copy using basic CSS techniques.

On Splashpad, I'm focusing only on recreating the look of Unsplash, and its basic responsiveness across different screen sizes.

## What's Missing

Limited to HTML and CSS, I'm not able to recreate most of the interactivity of Unsplash, including the on-click behavior of buttons and other interactive elements. However, I do recreate most of the visual hover and focus effects.

Unsplash also uses JavaScript to populate its masonry photo layout. This is typically achieved with a library like [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/). There is also an infinite scrolling feature that populates the page with more photos when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page.

While I cannot replicate that with CSS, the CSS Multi Column Layout lets me simulate that.
